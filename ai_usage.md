# AI Usage Documentation (Draft)

This project used AI assistance (ChatGPT) for the following:
- Clarifying the project scope and selecting an appropriate biological question.
- Explaining concepts related to alignment-free genomic analysis and Chaos Game Representation (CGR).
- Helping structure code for CGR generation, XGBoost training, ResNet18 implementation, and Grad-CAM visualization.
- Assisting with troubleshooting and improving code readability.
- Improving the clarity, structure, and conciseness of the written draft report.
- Providing guidance on constructing the GitHub repository layout.

## Verification of AI Output
All AI-generated suggestions and explanations were verified manually by:
- Running the code step-by-step in Google Colab.
- Inspecting the generated CGR images and verifying they matched expected patterns.
- Confirming that model outputs (accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, Grad-CAM) were produced by the actual code.
- Revising or modifying AI-generated text as needed for accuracy and academic integrity.

## Ethics and Compliance
- No AI tools were used to fabricate or modify biological data.
- All results in this project were produced through real code execution on genuine viral genomes downloaded directly from NCBI.
- AI assistance was used only for explanation, editing, organization, and debugging support.
